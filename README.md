# Generalized Additive Model, aka GAM
## Introduction
To assess non-linear effects between predictors in a GLM, some methods can be considered such as binning the variables, adding some polynomial term, using a piecewise link function or using smoothing splines.
GAM simplifies the work by providing a general framework to automate the procedure to model the non-linear relationship. It can be understood as an extension of the linear model where the non-linear effects are assessed by a (smooth) non-linear function for each of the parameters present in the model.
